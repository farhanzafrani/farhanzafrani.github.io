Casted the Soft Robotic Actuators using Ecoflex 00-30 (silicone) that is an synthesized elastomer used in pneumatic based Soft Robotics. Achieved the desired bending using lower pressure of 60 Kpa. Controlled the actuator using the Raspberry PI 4 that was programmed using Python based on Machine Learning algorithms. Designed the Actuator using CAD software and simulated the actuator using ANSYS workbench for pressure requirements that came out to be 60 Kpa for single Actuator. Achieved an accuracy of 92% in prediction of the true hand gesture that ultimately controlled the actuator to rehabilitate the Stroke Patient Hand through Robotic Glove","highlights":["Soft Robotics","EMG","Machine Learning"],"startDate":"2022-06-01","endDate":"2023-06-05","url":"https://example.com"}]}
